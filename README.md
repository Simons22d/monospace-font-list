# monospace-font-list

My goal is to create a complete list of monospace fonts, to the extent
I can. Primarily for the fun of it, but sometimes I like to use fonts
that are really not all that programmer friendly when coding, or even
just when writing (in a text editor).

I've found a few lists here and there of programmer-friendly monospace
fonts, but none of them are exhaustive, and I also haven't seen any
lists that include fonts that are not necessarily
programmer-friendly. Namely, those inspired by or sourced from
20th-century typewriters.

Send an email to dse AT SIGN webonastick PERIOD com if you know of any
I've missed.  Or submit a patch---after all, this *is* a github
repository.

I might include images of screenshots, specimens, etc. in the future,
but for now this is a text-only list.

## Criteria

The only criteria for inclusion in this list are as follows:

-   That a font has to be monospace, and

-   that it (likely) has to have existed in a computerized format.

Other things that are not restrictions:

-   I accept free and open source fonts as well as commercial ones.

-   I accept programmer friendly fonts as well as fonts without
    programmer-friendly features.

If there are characters missing from the font I may or may not still
accept it for inclusion, possibly with a caveat.

If there are important characters, such as spaces or punctuation, that
are *not* the same width as other characters, I am likely to not
include it, or to include it in this list with a caveat.

## Reddit Threads

I posted about this project in [r/typewriters](https://www.reddit.com/r/typewriters/comments/aw9qb2/im_working_on_a_list_of_typewriter_monospace/),
[r/fonts](https://www.reddit.com/r/fonts/comments/aw9cn2/im_working_on_a_list_of_monospace_fonts_crosspost/),
and
[r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/aw9cv9/im_working_on_a_list_of_monospace_fonts_crosspost/),
in case you're looking for additional insight.

Not much love except in r/fonts though.
